## Summary
HTML5 LAYOUT
X The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of  
different parts of a web page and help to describe  
its structure.  
X The new elements provide clearer code (compared 
with using multiple <div> elements).  
X Older browsers that do not understand HTML5  
elements need to be told which elements are  
block-level elements.  
X To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8  
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,  
which is available free from Google.
