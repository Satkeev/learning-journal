### INTRODUCING CSS
>X CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside 
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that 
element should look. 

>X Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the 
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that 
indicate what these elements should look like). 

>X Different types of selectors allow you to target your 
rules at different elements. 

>X Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties 
of the element that you want to change, and the values 
of those properties. For example, the font-family 
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial 
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface. 

>X CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page. 

###The color property allows you 

>to specify the color of text inside 
an element. You can specify any 
color in CSS in one of three ways: 
rgb values 
These express colors in terms 
of how much red, green and 
blue are used to make it up. For 
example: rgb(100,100,90) 
 hex codes 
These are six-digit codes that 
represent the amount of red, 
green and blue in a color, 
preceded by a pound or hash # 
sign. For example: #ee3e80 
color names
There are 147 predefined color 
names that are recognized 
by browsers. For example: 

We look at these three different
ways of specifying colors on the
next double-page spread.

body {
background-color: rgb(200,200,200);}
h1 {
background-color: DarkCyan;}
h2 {
background-color: #ee3e80;}
p {
background-color: white;}
