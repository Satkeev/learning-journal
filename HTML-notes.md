### HTML notes
>They are covered here (rather than with the other HTML 
elements you met earlier in the book) because you'll find 
it easier to understand how they can be used now that you 
have seen how CSS can control the layout a page. These 
new elements are going to play an important part in creating 
layouts going forward. In this chapter you will see: 
● The new HTML5 layout elements and their uses 
● How they offer helpful alternatives to the <div> element 
● How to ensure older browsers recognize these elements 
As with all HTML5 and CSS3 content, its usage is still 
subject to change but it is already widely being used by web 
developers and it is likely that you will want to use them.
